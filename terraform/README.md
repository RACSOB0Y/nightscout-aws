# Nightscout-as-Code with Terraform

This (future) collection of Terraform configurations should enable almost anyone to deploy Nightscout to public cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure with little-to-no effort. 

At the moment AWS is supported.

Please see the guide here: [https://github.com/pkolyvas/nightscout-as-code/wiki](https://github.com/pkolyvas/nightscout-as-code/wiki). 

**NB** The guide is an unfinished draft at the moment.
