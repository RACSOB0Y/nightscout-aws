# NaC on AWS with Terraform

Nightscout-as-Code on AWS provides a template you can easily customize to provision and deploy nightscout on AWS.

## Requirements

- AWS Account
- A domain managed by Route53

Additionally you'll need a GitHub and Terraform Cloud account if you'd like the easy route. And by the easy route, we mean popping in a few variables for a push-button install (at least mostly).
